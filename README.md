# Airbnb scraper in Python

## Overview
This project is an open-source tool developed in Python for extracting product information from Airbnb. It's designed to be easy to use, making it an ideal solution for developers looking for Airbnb product data.

## Features
- Extract prices, available dates, reviews, host details and others
- Full search support
- Extracts detailed product information from Airbnb
- Implemented in Python just because it's popular
- Easy to integrate with existing Python projects
- The code is optimize to work on this format: ```https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/[room_id]```

## Legacy
- This was a project first implemented on:[https://github.com/johnbalvin/pybnb](https://github.com/johnbalvin/pybnb) but was moved to [https://github.com/johnbalvin/pyairbnb](https://github.com/johnbalvin/pyairbnb)
to match the name with pip name

## Important
- With the new airbnb changes, if you want to get the price from a room url you need to specify the date range
the date range should be on the format year-month-day, if you leave the date range empty, you will get the details but not the price


### Install

```bash
$ pip install pyairbnb
```
## Examples

### Example for Searching Listings

```python
from pyairbnb.search import search_all
import json

# Define search parameters
currency = "MXN"  # Currency for the search
check_in = "2025-02-01"  # Check-in date
check_out = "2025-02-04"  # Check-out date
ne_lat = -1.03866277790021  # North-East latitude
ne_long = -77.53091734683608  # North-East longitude
sw_lat = -1.1225978433925647  # South-West latitude
sw_long = -77.59713412765507  # South-West longitude
zoom_value = 2  # Zoom level for the map

# Search listings within specified coordinates and date range
search_results = search_all(check_in, check_out, ne_lat, ne_long, sw_lat, sw_long, zoom_value, currency, "")

# Save the search results as a JSON file
with open('search_results.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(search_results))  # Convert results to JSON and write to file
```

### Retrieving Details for Listings
#### Retrieve Prices, Availability, Reviews, and Host Information

```python
from pyairbnb.details import get_details
import json

# Define listing URL and parameters
room_url = "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/43198150"  # Listing URL
currency = "USD"  # Currency for the listing details
check_in = "2025-01-02"  # Check-in date
check_out = "2025-01-04"  # Check-out date

# Retrieve all listing details for the specified room URL and dates
data = get_details(room_url=room_url, currency=currency, check_in=check_in, check_out=check_out)

# Save the retrieved details to a JSON file
with open('details_data.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(data))  # Convert the data to JSON and save it
```

#### Retrieve Details Without Price
If pricing data is not needed, you can omit the date range.

```python
from pyairbnb.details import get_details
import json

# Define listing URL and parameters
room_url = "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1029961446117217643"  # Listing URL
currency = "USD"  # Currency for the listing details

# Retrieve listing details without including the price information (no check-in/check-out dates)
data = get_details(room_url=room_url, currency=currency)

# Save the retrieved details to a JSON file
with open('details_data.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(data))  # Convert the data to JSON and save it
```

#### Retrieve Details Using Room ID with Proxy
You can also use `get_details` with a room ID and an optional proxy.

```python
from pyairbnb.details import get_details
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import json

# Define listing parameters
room_id = 18039593  # Listing room ID
currency = "MXN"  # Currency for the listing details
proxy_url = "[your_proxy_url]"  # Proxy URL (if needed)

# Retrieve listing details by room ID with a proxy
data = get_details(room_id=room_id, currency=currency, proxy_url=proxy_url)

# Save the retrieved details to a JSON file
with open('details_data.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(data))  # Convert the data to JSON and save it
```

### Retrieve Reviews for a Listing
Use `get_reviews` to extract reviews and metadata for a specific listing.

```python
from pyairbnb.reviews import get_reviews
import json

# Define listing URL and proxy URL
room_url = "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/30931885"  # Listing URL
proxy_url = "[your_proxy_url]"  # Proxy URL (if needed)

# Retrieve reviews for the specified listing
reviews_data = get_reviews(room_url, proxy_url)

# Save the reviews data to a JSON file
with open('reviews.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(reviews_data["reviews"]))  # Extract reviews and save them to a file
```

### Retrieve Availability for a Listing
The `get_calendar` function provides availability information for specified listings.

```python
from pyairbnb.calendar import get_calendar
import json

# Define listing parameters
room_id = "44590727"  # Listing room ID
proxy_url = "[your_proxy_url]"  # Proxy URL (if needed)

# Retrieve availability for the specified listing
calendar_data = get_calendar(room_id, "", proxy_url)

# Save the calendar data (availability) to a JSON file
with open('calendar.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(calendar_data["calendar"]))  # Extract calendar data and save it to a file
```
